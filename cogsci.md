Research, articles & discussion. [Under construction]

Studying the brain and how it functions may provide us with not only answers for artificial intelligence, but a closer look into what we are.

Points of interest:

Abduction is a type of reasoning that is also known as ‘inference to the best explanation’. This entails choosing what seems to be the best explanation given some data.

If we want to be formal, we can define it like so: ...

A tried and tested source of inspiration for artificial intelligence has always been biology, and neural networks are no different. One of the most powerful approaches, reinforcement learning, is directly inspired by the natural process through which animals learn, namely a reward-and-punishment system paired with a trial-and-error mechanism of action. Combined with deep neural networks, this approach has seen unprecendented success.

There is an interesting article I recently came across, titled...

It is worth taking a post or so to lay out the main theory of how the mind works, which undergirds the entire field of cognitive science -- a theory known as the 'computational' theory of mind. Ever since the explosion of progress in computer science, the question arose of whether or not the brain/mind could be seen as a type of extremely complex computer; one that takes in some inputs, then stores, manipulates, or transforms information, and then outputs it...
