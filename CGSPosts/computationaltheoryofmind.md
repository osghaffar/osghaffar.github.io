## The Computational Theory of Mind

We should begin by discussing the main theory of cognitive science -- what is known as the **computational theory of mind**, often referred to as 'functionalism'. Following behaviorism and other schools of thought, this theory took off after the explosion of progress in computer science. Alan Turing was a main proponent

The theory states that the brain acts akin to a computer; the brain and neural circuits throughout the body form a type of connective network. Using some type of input-output mechanism, information can be transferred via complex pathways, or can be represented physically somehow, like a program on a computer stores information.

There are still, of course, other algorithms or models which take different theories as their core assumption. Reinforcement learning, for example, adopts a behaviorist approach. An agent performs an action $A$, either to receive some reward $R$ or some punishment $P$, until the behavior of the agent (over many, many training sets) is optimized for the task and the environment, very similar to how a behaviorist like B.F. Skinner would have defined behavior as a conditioned response to some stimuli.

One good example of adopting a computational model of the mind, as something that stores and processes information, is George Miller's hypothesis that working memory was around seven items. For example, if we take the set 

$$ \set{\text{cat, dog, apple, sky, tree, fruit, person, car}} $$

the average person will not be able to memorize these in a short-term sort of way. But if we decrease the size to 6 or 7, a person typically will be able to memorize them in a short-term sense and perhaps transfer the information to paper or elsewhere (this is why authentication confirmation codes are around seven digits).
