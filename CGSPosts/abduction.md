## Abduction as Intuition
**Abduction** is a type of reasoning that is also known as 'inference to the best explanation'. This entails choosing what seems to be the best explanation given some data.

If we want to be formal, we can define it like so:

<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="font-size:16px">
  <ul style="font-size:16px">
    <li> <b>Inference to the Best Explanation</b>: If hypothesis <i>H</i> gives the best explanation of some phenomena when compared with other rival hypotheses <i>H<sub>1</sub></i>, . . . , <i>H<sub>n</sub></i>, we may accept <i>H</i> as true, or at least we should prefer <i>H</i> over <i>H<sub>1</sub></i>, . . . , <i>H<sub>n</sub></i>. </li>
  </ul>
</p>

Imagine, for example, it's a cold winter day, and it snowed the night before. As you reach your car, evading the ice all over the ground, you hear a loud thud, followed by a person groaning in pain. You turn to see a person laying on the ground, with a patch of ice nearby. What would you conclude? It seems the most obvious interpretation of such an event is that the person slipped on some ice and fell. Is it the *only* possible explanation? Certainly not. But it is the *best* explanation given some set of observations or data.

This type of thinking is everywhere in our daily lives. We use this consciously and deliberately in all types of jobs. Let's look at more examples:

<p class="has-text-align-justify" style="font-size:16px">
  <ul style="font-size:16px">
  <li> Doctors or other medical professionals do not have certainty behind their reasoning. Rather, they diagnose a patient based on symptoms, observations, and test results, which narrow down the options until the doctor can decide which is most likely (i.e, the best explanation).</li>
  <li> Criminal investigators use all the data they can to tell the most plausible story about how the crime occurred. They may only have parts here and there -- a murder weapon, partial surveillance footage, cell tower data -- and have to piece it together. </li>
 <li> Scientists choose what appears to be the best theory based on how it explains the data. The Big Bang theory, famously, held out on replacing the previous steady-state view of the universe until it became more and more obvious that it did indeed explain the data better. This is generally how older theories (phlogiston, for example) get replaced by newer ones (oxidation) as more data is discovered and put into consideration. Science is built on the very idea of IBE. </li>
  </ul>
</p>

But a more interesting aspect of this thinking is the way we seem to use it subconsciously as well. 

Think of a notorious problem for AI -- the ambiguity of language. Words often have multiple correct meanings, depending on the context (a frustrating fact for someone learning a new language) and the lines between which words can or cannot be used in a particular context may be rather vague -- "let's hit the road" does not mean to stand over the concrete and begin striking it; nor does "that song was a hit" have anything to do with physical contact. Even more complex are cases like "the economy took a hit", where it has negative connotations, contrary to the music, but still does not relate to physical contact.

Here, we use this type of reasoning to understand what a person most likely means, given background data and situational context, even if we have never heard the word before or seen a sentence used this way before. But the noteworthy thing about this is that we often do this subconsciously; we follow along with a conversation with minimal effort, piecing together the intended meaning of the speaker as they talk. 

This indicates that abduction, or inference to the best explanation, is not merely a higher-order cognitive process that we do with intention and awareness (like, studying, for example). Rather, it must be something more deeply rooted, like most other intuitions we have.

### Experimental Evidence

In addition to the other reasons suggesting abduction is intuitive, there are some experiments which also seem to indicate this. The above, an experiment found in Irvin Rock's _The Logic of Perception_ (1983), is an optical illusion that seems to add evidence to this view.

Take a look at the left. There appears to be a transparent square overlayed over the larger, checkered square. However, it isn't really there. Instead, corners of each section are colored differently, and our brain arrives at this view because it is the "best" explanation of the data, given our background information, cognitive faculties, and other factors. When the colors are shifted, the 'transparent square' seems to disappear. 

### Other considerations
It seems clear that abduction, or inference to the best explanation, is built into our cognitive processes. We use this reasoning consciously and subconsciously, and to great success. A few points of interest can be raised. Can we trust this intuition despite not really knowing how it works? What exactly is it that makes one explanation *better* than another, objectively speaking? How do other cognitive biases affect the way we see the "best explanation"? 

Additionally, what are the evolutionary origins of such an intuition? Bas van Fraassen notes that an evolutionary explanation, based on fitness, seems puzzling. 

<blockquote>
"The naturalistic response bases the conclusion on the fact of our adaptation to nature, our evolutionary success which must be due to a certain fitness. But in this particular case, the conclusion will not follow without a hypothesis of preadaptation, contrary to what is allowed by Darwinism. ... [It] does not select for internal virtuesâ€”not even ones that could increase the chance of adaptation or even survival beyond the short run. Our new theories cannot be more likely to be true, merely given that we were the ones to think of them and we have characteristics selected for in the past, because the success at issue is success in the future."
