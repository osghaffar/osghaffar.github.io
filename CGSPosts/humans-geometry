## Human-Unique Abilities: Geometric Knowledge and Nativism

Humans possess many unique abilities, which is part of the reason we find ourselves outpacing other species by an extremely large margin. We seem to be alone in our ability to build, imagine, study and invent. One particular ability we possess is knowledge of geometric shapes â€” which shows up in our artwork, buildings and other artifacts, dating back to ancient times. Geometric shapes can be found in prehistoric cave artwork, such as the ones in Lascaux, France that date back to several thousands of years ago. Similarly, in this case, no other species purposefully produces anything featuring geometric shapes, either in part or whole. 



Imagine, for example, it's a cold winter day, and the ground has iced over the night before. As you reach your car, evading the ice all over the ground, you hear a loud thud behind you, followed by a person groaning in pain. You turn to see a person laying on the ground, with a solid patch of ice nearby. Their belongings are all over the ground. Based on these observations, what would you conclude? 
It seems the most obvious interpretation of such a series of events is that the person slipped on some ice and fell. Is it the *only* possible explanation? Certainly not. But it is the best explanation given some set of observations or data.
