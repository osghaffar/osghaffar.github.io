Research, articles & discussion. [Under construction]

Studying the brain and how it functions may provide us with not only answers for artificial intelligence, but a closer look into who and what we are.

Points of interest:

  <ul>
  <li>What are some neuro/biological mechanisms of the brain that we can learn from?</li>
  <li>What is intelligence? How can it be accurately measured, and how can we guage it in other than humans?</li>
  <li>Is general/super/real artificial intelligence possible? What would it entail? Are our current stastical optimization methods not good enough?</li>
  <li>What is consciousness? Does AI need "consciousness"?</li>
  <li>What is it that makes humans so different to other creatures? Can it be objectively defined? </li>

A tried and tested source of inspiration for artificial intelligence has always been biology, and neural networks are no different. One of the most powerful approaches, reinforcement learning, is directly inspired by the natural process through which animals learn, namely a reward-and-punishment system paired with a trial-and-error mechanism of action. Combined with deep neural networks, this approach has seen unprecendented success.

There is an interesting article I recently came across, titled...
