## The Computational Theory of Mind

We should begin by discussing the main theory of cognitive science -- what is known as the **computational theory of mind**, often referred to as 'functionalism'. This theory took off after the explosion of progress in computer science. Alan Turing was a main proponent

The theory states that the brain acts akin to a computer; the brain and neural circuits throughout the body form a type of connective network. Using some type of input-output mechanism, information can be transferred via complex pathways, or can be represented physically somehow, like a program on a computer stores information.
