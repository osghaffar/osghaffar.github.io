## Abduction as Intuition
*Abduction* is a type of reasoning that is also known as "Inference to the Best Explanation". This entails choosing what seems to be the best explanation, given some number of explanations.

Imagine it's a cold winter day, and it snowed the night before. As you reach your car, evading the ice all over the ground, you hear a loud thud, followed by a person groaning in pain. You turn to see a person laying on the ground, with a patch of ice nearby. What would you conclude? It seems the most obvious interpretation of such an event is that the person slipped on some ice and fell. Is it the *only* possible explanation? Certainly not. But it is the *best* explanation given some set of observations or data.

This type of thinking is everywhere in our daily lives. We use this consciously and deliberately in all types of jobs. Let's look at three examples:

  - (1): Doctors or other medical professionals do not have some logical certainty behind their reasoning. Rather, they diagnose a patient based on symptoms, observations, and test results, which narrow down the options until the doctor can decide which is most likely.
  - (2): Criminal investigators use all the data they can to tell the most plausible story about how the crime occurred. They may only have parts here and there -- a murder weapon, partial surveillance footage, cell tower data -- and have to piece it together.
  - (3): Scientists choose what appears to be the best theory based on how it explains the data. The Big Bang theory, famously, held out on replacing the previous steady-state view of the universe until it became more and more obvious that it did indeed explain the data better. This is generally how older theories (phlogiston, for example) get replaced by newer ones (oxidation) as more data is discovered and considered. Science is built on the very idea of IBE.

But a more interesting aspect of this thinking is the way we seem to use it subconsciously as well. Think of a notorious problem for AI -- the ambiguity of language. Words often have multiple correct meanings, depending on the context (a frustrating fact for someone learning a new language) and the lines between which words can or cannot be used in a particular context may be rather vague -- "let's hit the road" does not mean to stand over the concrete and begin striking it; nor does "that song was a hit" have anything to do with physical contact. Even more complex are cases like "the economy took a hit", where it has negative connotations, contrary to the music, but still does not relate to physical contact.

Here, we use this type of reasoning to understand what a person most likely means, given background data and situational context, even if we have never heard the word before or seen a sentence used this way before.

This indicates that abduction, or inference to the best explanation, is not merely a higher-order cognitive process that we do with intention and awareness (like, studying, for example). Rather, it appears to be much more deeply rooted, as an intuition.
